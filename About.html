        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Rachel Moment</strong>, the creator of <strong>Toddler Time</strong>. As a full-stack developer and a proud mom of a toddler with sensory processing disorder, I understand firsthand the challenges and joys of parenting. Like many parents, I searched for tools to help my child develop essential life skills, but I struggled to find something that truly made a difference. That’s when the idea for Toddler Time was born.</p>
        <p><strong>Toddler Time</strong> is more than just an app—it’s a personalized, engaging tool designed to help parents and caregivers support their toddlers in learning daily routines like brushing teeth, using the potty, and more. It also provides features to help children understand and identify emotions, all while keeping learning fun and engaging. As a parent, I know how important routines and interactive learning are, especially for children on the autism spectrum, which is why I made it my mission to design something that benefits all kids.</p>
        <p>With a background in full-stack development, I’ve poured my heart and skills into this project, blending my technical knowledge with my personal experience to create something meaningful. <strong>Toddler Time</strong> is built to be a resource for parents looking to make a positive impact on their children’s development, just like I am for mine.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being here and joining me on this journey to make learning and growth easier for all our little ones.</p>
